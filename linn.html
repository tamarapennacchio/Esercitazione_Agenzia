        Swedish illustrator, designer and animator Linn Fritz 
        lives and works in London where she creates charmingly 
        clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for
         a wide range of editorial and commercial clients. 
         Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her time 
         at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as “hands 
         down one of the best experiences” of her life.
          “My Hyper Island journey completely changed me as 
          a person.” she says, “It pushed me to work harder 
          and gave me the tools to succeed in the real world.” 
          The progressive nature of Hyper Island led Linn to 
          abandon pen and paper and concentrate on what digital 
          could offer her already well-honed drawings. 
          As she puts it, “There’s more freedom drawing 
          digitally, and more room for mistakes.” 
          Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, 
          Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, “a community
           of equality-driven women, trans and non-binary
            friends aiming to connect and support each other
             within the animation industry.” Some of her 
             favorite projects often orbit around her interests
              of “feminism, clothes, plants and interior” 
              but Linn also looks for a good client relationship,
               one with trust and creative freedom.
