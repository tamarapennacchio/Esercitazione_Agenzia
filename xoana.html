        The portfolio of LA-based illustrator Xoana Herrera is an 
        explosion of sumptuous, stylish character scenes dwelling 
        in a world that, frankly, looks ideal. Xoana trained as a
         graphic designer in Argentina but over time found herself 
         drawn to the world of illustration after a five-year stint
          at Buck agency. Now, alongside founding a feminist creative
           collective, Get it Girl, she creates graceful, complex and 
           accessible imagery which would be as at home in an ad campaign
            as it would be in a children’s book (which she's quite keen to
             try soon). “As an artist I think it is up to us to keep evolving
              and taking creative decisions,” she says. “Aiming to be innovative
               is something I feel I can dare to try every time I take a job, and
                that’s amazing.”
