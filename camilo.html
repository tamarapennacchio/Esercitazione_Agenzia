    <h5>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour,
         content and a brightly illustrated narrative
          that speaks for itself. Born and raised in
           Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his
            career between graphic design and painting.
             Working independently has allowed Camilo to
              “develop (his) own style, having a main 
              focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains. 
              In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he
               concentrates on graphic design projects in
                “a more commercial way”. However, within 
                illustration, he described his main motivation
                 as, “to be able to generate a communication
                  method based on simplicity and synthesis,
                   with few tools and colours.”  I am interested 
                   in identifying people’s behaviour, portraying 
                   activities, intimate moments, body gestures, 
                   disfiguring objects and reducing the amount 
                   of detail in a composition.” Camilo is fascinated
                    by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits,
                     often depicting scenic bus routes, art galleries
                      and public figures in his own psychedelically 
                      shaped style. “Within my work I try to reproduce 
                      real moments from an innocent and impartial perspective.”
