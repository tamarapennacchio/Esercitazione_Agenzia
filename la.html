        La Boca have the rare, impressive ability to create 
        designs and artwork resembling some of the best album
         sleeves lurking in your dad’s record collection. 
         The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London
          and has gathered an envious collection of awards, 
          including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, 
          and the AOI Illustration Awards. Their exquisitely
           executed, psychedelic style is the combined result 
           of each of the studio's members' unique influences,
            having hailed from London, Bordeaux, Devon and 
            Switzerland. “We work as a studio, so most of our
             designs are created as a team,” says Scott Bendall 
             of La Boca. “It's not unusual to have two or three
              people working on a single piece.” Keen to work 
              on more animated projects in the future, the team
               (based in two studios, one in London and one in
                Amsterdam) are never short on work from a selection
                 of devoted clients. In their own words, La Boca’s
                  creations are: “Retina teasing, tactile and
                   occasionally slightly wonky.”
