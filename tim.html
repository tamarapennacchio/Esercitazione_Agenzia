    <h5>
        San Francisco-based artist Tim Lahan’s naughty,
        witty artwork is the product of his ability to 
        digest and illustrate clever glitches, concepts
        and interesting visual cues from the world around him. 
        “I generally aim to make things as simple as possible,” 
        says Tim. “Sometimes they come out funny.” Generally 
        commissioned to bring a touch of joy to magazines, 
        brand campaigns and music collateral, the ADC Young
        Gun award winner’s instantly recognisable style is 
        enviably simple and genuinely funny: something very
        few illustrators can boast.
